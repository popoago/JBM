# JBM Assignment

### This repo contains the web deployment for the assignment using [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) models on Render.

The *web application* has been deployed at https://defect-identifier.onrender.com

The **model weights** are stored at: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1giL_NMBIdBpqsh99lOvTLeMF2OklBSDm

The python notebook **fastai_code** contains the implementation using fastai.

**approach.txt** contains the approach followed for the assignment.

###  This repo also contains the apk file created using tensorflow lite for android

All the files related to tensorflow are stored in the folder **tensorflow**.

The **apk** was trained on mobilenet and therefore sometimes gives unsatisfactory output.

The trained **model file** is available at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UdBnlHsumNnH91lUKEtuFZTSTDOmZjki/view?usp=sharing

The folder also contains the python notebook **tf_code** for training the dataset.
